The potential of deep learning to advance lung nodule detection from chest X-rays is significantly compromised by the lack of large annotated databases and noisy labels in the existing databases. The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of the novel Confident Learning approach for chest X-ray database cleaning and nodule detection improving.
