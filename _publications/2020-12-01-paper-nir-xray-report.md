reports: A case study for Russian language"

excerpt: 'â€”In this paper, we analyze possible approaches for
diagnosis identification in Russian medical reports. Firstly, we
introduce the main problems of raw Russian medical reports
preprocessing. Secondly, focusing on the embedding extraction
method, we analyzed several publicly available models and
discovered that the use of BERT model is a promising instrument
for this task. Performing the first attempt to build the NLP
system for the Russian medical report classification based on
the embeddings extraction method, we formulated the main
weaknesses that limit the use of the existing publicly available
Russian NLP models in the medical-text domain. Having no
labeled data available, we evaluate each model visually, analyzing
embeddings representation in 2D field retrieved by dimensionality
reduction using t-SNE. We assume that a good model will be
able to place reports that describe the same diagnosis close to
each other, while moving reports with distinct diagnoses far from
each other, forming clusters. Finally, we proposed several ways
of possible future research that, as we believe, will improve the
results achieved in this field so far.'
