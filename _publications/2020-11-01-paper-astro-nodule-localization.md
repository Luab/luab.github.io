title: "Automated Localization of Lung Nodules from Chest X-rays With Deep Neural Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-01-paper-astro-nodule-localization
excerpt: 'Lung cancer constitutes more than 20% of all cancer deaths in the Russian Federation. About 34.2% of these cases were diagnosed late, which significantly reduces the life expectancy of patients. Chest X-rays are the main screening method for lung cancer in Russia. The small size of nodules and difficult localizations are the reasons why nodules are often missed during routine scanning. The aim of this study is to employ modern deep learning tools for the localization of nodules in chest X-Rays.'
